## What is a Lambda Function in Python?

- A lambda function is an anonymous, small, and inline function defined using the `lambda` keyword. It's often used for simple operations and short expressions.

## Syntax of a Lambda Function

- The syntax is: `lambda arguments: expression`
- For example: `lambda x, y: x + y`

## Difference Between Lambda Function and Regular Function

- Lambda functions are one-liners used for simple operations, while regular functions are defined using the `def` keyword and can have multiple statements and more complex logic.

## Use Cases for Lambda Functions

- Use lambda functions for small, simple operations that can be expressed concisely. For more complex logic, regular functions are more appropriate.

## Example of Using a Lambda Function

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
result = add(3, 5)  # Result will be 8
```

## Lambda Functions with Built-in Functions

- Lambda functions are often used as the first argument to functions like `map`, `filter`, and `sorted` to define the operation on each element.

## Limitations of Lambda Functions

- A lambda function is limited to a single expression. It cannot contain multiple expressions or lines of code.

## Purpose of the `key` Parameter in `sorted`

- The `key` parameter is used to specify a function that calculates a value for each element. This value is then used for sorting.

## Lambda Functions in `map` and `filter`

- In the `map` function, a lambda function is applied to each element of an iterable to create a new iterable with the results.
- In the `filter` function, a lambda function is used to filter elements based on a condition, creating a new iterable with the filtered elements.

## Example Use Case for a Lambda Function

- Here's an example of using a lambda function to sort a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple:

```python
data = [(1, 5), (3, 2), (2, 8)]
sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Result: [(3, 2), (1, 5), (2, 8)]
```

## Performance Comparison with Regular Functions

- Generally, lambda functions and regular functions have similar performance. The choice between them is more about readability and code organization.

Remember that lambda functions are a concise way to define small operations, but they have limitations due to their single-expression nature. Be prepared to demonstrate how to use lambda functions with built-in functions and explain their role in functional programming.
