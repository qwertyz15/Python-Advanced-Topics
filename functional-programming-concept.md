## Understanding Functional Programming

- Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
- It emphasizes immutability, declarative code, and avoiding side effects.

## Immutability

- Immutability refers to the property that once an object is created, its value cannot be changed.
- In functional programming, immutability is favored to prevent unintended modifications.

## Pure Functions

- A pure function always produces the same output for the same input and has no side effects.
- It doesn't modify external state or rely on external variables.

## Side Effects

- Side effects are changes to program state or the external world caused by a function, aside from its return value.
- Functional programming aims to minimize side effects to improve predictability and maintainability.

## Referential Transparency

- Referential transparency means a function can be replaced with its return value without affecting program behavior.
- Pure functions exhibit referential transparency.

## Function Composition

- Function composition combines multiple functions to create a new function.
- It enables building complex operations from simpler ones.

## Higher-Order Functions

- Higher-order functions take functions as arguments or return functions.
- They allow abstracting common patterns and promoting code reusability.

## Lambda Functions

- Lambda functions (anonymous functions) are defined with the `lambda` keyword.
- They are concise and often used for short operations.

## Map, Filter, and Reduce

- `map` applies a function to each item in an iterable.
- `filter` selects items from an iterable based on a condition.
- `reduce` cumulatively applies a function to reduce an iterable to a single value.

## Currying

- Currying transforms a function taking multiple arguments into a series of functions taking one argument.
- It supports partial function application and simplifies function composition.

## Tail Recursion

- Tail recursion occurs when a function's last operation is the recursive call.
- Some languages optimize tail-recursive functions to reduce memory usage.

## Functional Programming in Python

- While not purely functional, Python supports many functional programming concepts.
- It offers higher-order functions, lambda functions, and list comprehensions.
