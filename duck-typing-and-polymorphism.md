# Duck Typing and Polymorphism in Python

Duck typing and polymorphism are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, particularly in dynamically-typed languages like Python. This README addresses common questions about duck typing and polymorphism and provides insights into their usage.

## What is Duck Typing?

- Duck typing is a programming concept where the type or class of an object is determined by its behavior (methods and properties) rather than its explicit type.
- It's often summarized as "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck."

## Relation of Duck Typing to Python

- Python, a dynamically-typed language, embraces duck typing. It focuses on an object's behavior rather than its specific class or type.

## What is Polymorphism?

- Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in a way appropriate for their individual types or classes.
- It allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of a common base class.

## Polymorphism in Python

- In Python, polymorphism is achieved through duck typing. Objects with methods of the same name and behavior can be used interchangeably.

## Example of Duck Typing and Polymorphism in Python

```python
class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

def animal_sound(animal):
    return animal.speak()

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print(animal_sound(dog))  # Output: Woof!
print(animal_sound(cat))  # Output: Meow!
```

## Advantages of Duck Typing and Polymorphism

- Duck typing and polymorphism promote code reusability and flexibility. Functions or methods can work with various objects as long as they provide the expected behavior.

## Comparison to Interfaces and Abstract Classes

- In statically-typed languages like Java or C++, interfaces and abstract classes define a contract. In Python, duck typing achieves similar flexibility without explicit interfaces or base classes.

## Handling Objects without Expected Methods

- If an object lacks the expected method, a runtime error occurs when calling the method. Programmers must ensure objects support expected behavior.

## Practical Use Cases for Duck Typing and Polymorphism

- Practical applications include creating reusable functions for different object types, implementing plugins, and facilitating seamless collaboration between diverse classes.
