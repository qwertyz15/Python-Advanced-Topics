# Descriptors and Properties in Python

Descriptors and properties are advanced concepts in Python that provide control over attribute access and manipulation in classes. Here's an overview of frequently asked questions about descriptors and properties in interviews.

## Understanding Descriptors

- A descriptor is an object that customizes attribute access in a class.
- It defines how getting, setting, and deleting attributes are handled.

## Defining Descriptor Methods

- A descriptor can define three main methods: `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__`.
- These methods are called when an attribute is accessed, set, or deleted.

## The `property` Function

- The `property` function allows you to create a special kind of attribute that calls a method upon access.
- It's commonly used to create computed or calculated attributes.

## Using the `@property` Decorator

- The `@property` decorator defines a method as a "getter" for a computed attribute.
- It allows you to access the method like an attribute.

## Creating Read-Only Properties

- A read-only property is a property with a getter method but no setter method.
- It enables reading the value but not changing it directly.

## Implementing Computed Properties

- Computed properties are attributes calculated based on other attributes.
- Descriptors can be used to create computed properties by defining the `__get__` method.

## Difference Between Descriptors and Regular Methods

- A descriptor controls attribute access at the class level.
- A regular method is called on an instance of the class.

## The Purpose of `__slots__`

- The `__slots__` attribute is used to explicitly define attributes a class can have.
- It can help reduce memory usage and improve attribute access speed.

Demonstrate your understanding of descriptors and properties by explaining these concepts, providing code examples, and highlighting their role in controlling attribute access and ensuring data integrity. Effective use of descriptors and properties contributes to well-structured and maintainable code.
